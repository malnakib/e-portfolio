          <p>
            Computing is a dynamic and rapidly evolving field that underpins
            modern technological advancements across various industries. This
            module, Launch into Computing, provides students with a
            comprehensive introduction to core computing disciplines, including
            Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity, Data
            Science, and Enterprise IT Management. By exploring the fundamental
            principles, methodologies, and emerging trends within these fields,
            students will develop a strong theoretical foundation while also
            engaging in practical applications relevant to real-world enterprise
            computing challenges.

          <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Identify and critically analyse computing challenges and processes
              in business systems, accounting for the current enterprise
              landscape.
            </li>
            <li>
              Gather and synthesise information from multiple sources (including
              internet resources and business publications) to aid in the
              systematic design and analysis of computing challenges.
            </li>

            <li>
              Critically evaluate appropriate methodologies, tools and
              techniques to mitigate and/or solve computing issues and their
              business impact.
            </li>
            <li>
              Articulate the legal, social, ethical, and professional issues
              faced by computing professionals.
            </li>

            <li>Reflect on team collaboration and professional growth.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            Through this module, I learned how to formalize and structure
            project ideas using UML, wireframes, and requirement specifications.
            It sharpened my collaboration and planning skills, laying a strong
            foundation for future technical modules.
